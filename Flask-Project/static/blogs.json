But what does the policy mean to the people, the construction industry and other stakeholders in the State?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, the concept of integrated township policy is based on the &lsquo;Walk to Work&rsquo; idea and it paves way for multiple aspects, especially decongestion of growth apart from spurring development in new areas. More importantly, it focuses on better quality of life and besides boosting real estate, the integrated township policy will aid in planned and sustainable growth in different areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government is planning to develop satellite townships around the Outer Ring Road, which will aid in spreading the growth in the city and other parts in the State.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Municipal Administration and Urban Development Minister KT Rama Rao had said the integrated township policy was aimed at decongesting Hyderabad by encouraging real estate development beyond the Outer Ring Road (ORR).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea is to promote growth and development in new areas and offer more benefits to real estate developers to develop more satellite townships and counter magnets about 5 km outside of the ORR, the Minister said at a recent programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main objective of the policy is to encourage and promote large scale integrated development with private and public initiatives that would result in optimization of land use, leveraging of ORR infrastructure and beyond, promote Transit Oriented Development, achieve economies of scale, increase housing facilities and better provision of infrastructure facilities and amenities based on the &lsquo;walk to work&rsquo; concept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strange it may sound but only Gujarat and Maharashtra are the other two States in the country which have integrated township policies. The Telangana government is taking the right steps by coming up with an integrated township policy and it will go a long way in boosting the State&rsquo;s image for promoting planned and sustainable growth, said CREDAI Telangana president G. Ram Reddy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Integrated townships are all about providing required infrastructure, including social, health, education and others in a particular place. These townships will serve as growth centres and make people&rsquo;s life a lot simple and comfortable. Imagine walking to office, children walking to schools, hospitals, super markets, malls, entertainment facilities in close vicinity. This will cut down travel time, pollution and fuel lot of real estate activity, explains Reddy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is lot of land available along the ORR and the government can capitalize by promoting integrated townships. Places like Kokapet, Kollur, Narsingi and even Kompally have good prospects for developing integrated townships, he suggests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Now, all the national players will look at Hyderabad and come up with new projects. Integrated Township policy is a good move and needs to be promoted in a big way&rdquo; says Reddy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Welcoming the policy, developers want the government to focus on developing road connectivity to the townships, besides ensuring proper transportation options for people.</p>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"

According to the research report titled &#39;WFH, #WorkfromHyderabad&#39;, in terms of the commercial market, Hyderabad is one of the few cities that recorded positive rental growth of 2% year-on-year (YoY) in Q3 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Residential prices have grown by a significant 5.3% Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) in 10 years, and even during the present COVID-19 challenge, rents continue to remain steady.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hyderabad is among the only two metro cities, the other being Bengaluru, that have not seen a fall in residential prices despite the ensuing market uncertainties and low sales, says the report released in Hyderabad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the report, Hyderabad witnessed a remarkable growth in corporate activity over the last five years and jumped from a rank of sixth in 2014 to second in 2019 in terms of annual office space demand across key cities in the country. Hyderabad Airport&#39;s share of passenger traffic handled in the country has increased from 5.5% in 2014-15 to 6.4% in 2019-20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the report, since the formation of the state, Telangana&#39;s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has significantly grown to Rs 6.63 trillion in 2019-2020 from Rs 4.16 trillion in 2014 with a CAGR of 8.08% which is considerably higher than the national real GDP CAGR of 5.7% for the same period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The driver of the state&#39;s economic growth has been the tertiary sector (services sector) dominated by the Information Technology (IT) services. Telangana IT/ITeS exports contributed revenue of Rs 1.25 trillion in the year 2019-2020, with 18% annual growth against Rs 1.9 trillion in 2018-19. The city is the second-largest contributor to the revenue from IT exports in the country and is home to global bigwigs like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report also highlighted that, as the conventional real estate asset classes struggle to get back on their feet on account of the ongoing pandemic, two new asset classes are seeing a sudden spurt in demand - data centres and warehouses. The forced shift to e-commerce to enable contactless business and to fulfil physical distancing norms has created a need for more warehouses and logistic centres across the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hyderabad, being the distribution hub in Telangana, is also seeing increased traction in the warehousing segment. Telangana is among the very few states in India to have an independent data centres policy, as early as 2016. The state has already garnered an investment of Rs 25,000 crore for data centre mega projects. Recently, Flipkart opened its data centre in Hyderabad, second after Chennai, to support its core operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telangana Industry and Information Technology Minister K T Rama Rao inaugurated the new office in Dallas Centre, Knowledge City, located in the premier IT-Hub.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rama Rao noted that Hyderabad has transformed into the new tech hub of India in the last six years. IT sector presence in the city has also transitioned from mere backend operations to primary production and product development services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shishir Baijal, Chairman and Managing Director, Knight Frank India, said besides IT/ITeS, the Telangana government has increased impetus on industries such as pharmaceutical and life sciences, food processing, electronics, and textiles in a bid to diversify its economic interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last four years, Telangana attracted investments of over Rs 10,000 crore in the life sciences industry. To give a further boost to this industry, the state government has released the Life Sciences Policy of Telangana and launched vital projects such as Genome Valley 2.0, Hyderabad Pharma City, and Medical Devices Park in Sultanpur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Samson Arthur, Branch Director - Hyderabad, Knight Frank India said that Hyderabad has been ranked high across categories of living and business. It is now emerging with modern business clusters and holds promise for new industrial ecosystems on the lines of the successful IT sector.</p>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"

It does not have a problem with investing as long as the returns are assured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AP government had envisaged that all construction works would be taken up by the SPV, but the Singapore government has said that some works can be allotted through the SPV to other companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Officials said that the Singapore government has stated that it can develop the land and sell it to other companies and also construct some buildings to sell to companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Singapore government has also apparently suggested to the AP government not to allot land to the owners at the same place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After pooling 30,000 acres, 15,000 acres will be shared between&nbsp; land owners and the government. If the land is shared equally, the government will get 7,500 acres of land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>State government officials now say that they are not sure about the Singapore government investing in the SPV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They say that the Singapore government is calculating everything from a business angle and is only looking at the profit aspect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Singapore government officials are likely to visit Hyderabad in January when they will discuss the details of setting up the SPV with AP government officials.</p>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"

He said the foundation stone will be laid at the IT hub at Kompally in Medchal-Malkajgiri district soon apart from the inauguration of IT tower in Khammam on December 7.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe minister said there was an overwhelming response for the Growth in Dispersion (GRID), which was proposed to focusing on promoting dispersed growth across Greater Hyderabad especially at the places like&nbsp;Nacharam&nbsp;and Uppal industrial areas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA day after GHMC elections results, KTR, who is also TRS working president, went back to routine after a gap of nearly a month and held a review meeting on IT and Ease of Doing Business with officials on December 5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>KTR said the state government had already initiated measures for expansion of IT to towns like&nbsp;Warangal, Khammam and Mahbubnagar. &quot;Two companies are evincing interest in setting their shops in Warangal in the second phase. The&nbsp;Telangana&nbsp;State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC) should make arrangements for providing infrastructure facilities at the IT tower in Warangal,&quot; the minister said.
